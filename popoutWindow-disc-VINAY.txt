wfh? 2:39 PM 
any idea y the same content bhaves with less performance in popped out window dud? 2:41 PM 
i guess u r bz 2:46 PM 
 
Raikar, Vinay (GE Transportation)  
yes, wfh 2:46 PM 
 
Shamimpm, Abid (GE Transportation)  
ok 2:47 PM 
 
Raikar, Vinay (GE Transportation)  
it's coz the operations happen on child window from the main window.. 2:47 PM 
 
Shamimpm, Abid (GE Transportation)  
any way to optimize it? 2:47 PM 
 
Raikar, Vinay (GE Transportation)  
so, say jQuery has to check references & other stuff from the child window.. which is slow, I guess 2:48 PM 
 
Shamimpm, Abid (GE Transportation)  
exactly 2:48 PM 
coz v don add anythin xtra 2:48 PM 
 
Raikar, Vinay (GE Transportation)  
just check which operations are slow 2:48 PM 
identify the functions 2:48 PM 
 
Shamimpm, Abid (GE Transportation)  
ok 2:48 PM 
n then rewriting the functions? 2:48 PM 
those functions? 2:48 PM 
 
Raikar, Vinay (GE Transportation)  
and in those functions, try to optimize in such a way that it uses correct references.. 2:49 PM 
 
Shamimpm, Abid (GE Transportation)  
lik? 2:49 PM 
for eg? 2:49 PM 
 
Raikar, Vinay (GE Transportation)  
yes, I guess it will mostly be using the appropriate $container & other DOM references 2:49 PM 
say a function uses $container.. 2:49 PM 
 
Shamimpm, Abid (GE Transportation)  
yeah 2:50 PM 
 
Raikar, Vinay (GE Transportation)  
that function has to use $container with $ reference from child window 2:50 PM 
something like `childwindow.$($container)` 2:50 PM 
I say, identify the $ object first 2:50 PM 
I think there is some code for that 2:50 PM 
contentwindow.$ or something like that 2:51 PM 
and use that reference within the functions 2:51 PM 
 
Shamimpm, Abid (GE Transportation)  
in that case for the main window? 2:51 PM 
wudnt b ther any prob? 2:51 PM 
 
Raikar, Vinay (GE Transportation)  
no 2:51 PM 
$ should be reference for the $ of the window in which the DOM element is present 2:52 PM 
 
Shamimpm, Abid (GE Transportation)  
ok 2:52 PM
