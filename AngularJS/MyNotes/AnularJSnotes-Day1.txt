Philosophy

Ang - v opinionated framework
	forced u to use MVC pattern

durandal Vs angular


Angular used MV* pattern
	MVP (Presenter), MVC, MVVM



ang extends HTML vocabulary


http://plnkr.co/   - online IDE


ang js compiles dom by loading html, head, body etc to DOM...updates DOM

ng-app directive. wat node on the dom contains ng-app?

xpressions {{7+5}}


ng-controller


	create ad - prepare model and make it availabel to the view


$ is the prefix for angular
	angular internal service names are prefixed with $...a naming convention


$scope is bridge between model and view


ang gets xecuted document on ready

ang js is forgiving coz an undefined variable in view wil not throw any error

no control flow - no if else in view


controller shudnt contain any complex business logic

ang js is pragmatic

ng-src and ng-href delays the rendering of html avoiding display of curley braces.ng app compiles DOM.kThis html is known as template in angular js terminology & template + data = View. Loose coupling is evident here coz view is just displaying the message instead of retrieving it from DOM as in JQuery. DO not update UI from controller. Do not abuse rootscope. DOM is never exposed to teh controller.



Two way binding
	ng-model


ng-class-odd and ng-class-even
ng-show

ng-non-bindable	


ngcloak  - prevents early rendering of html elements with ng directives


bootstrap div class="col-md-3"


bgChecked



directives - events


view wil only communicate with the scope



ngChange - WARNING
	angular is state depepentnt (scopes state)
	ng-model="showHotels" and ng-show="showHotels"
	where showHotels is undefines/null/0/false

Views do not hold data. view is jz reflecting the data....


ANgular seed - scaffolding

angular.module('myApp', []);

angular.module('myApp').controller('topController, function($scope) {

.
