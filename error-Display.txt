504: Dave didn't come back quickly enough

This is embarrassing, you've asked for something and I've spent too long getting it. Maybe I got distracted by some pretty lights, but you'll never know.

Do check status.jsbin.com, but do ping @js_bin if this problem keeps happening.

If you want to add details please add it to the issues page and add any additional information you can to help diagnose this slackness.
